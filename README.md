# sanjacinto-conky-conf

I have tried to write a simple, clear and complete configuration for [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky)

You need to install _Font Awesome_ and _Conky Symbols_, the .ttf's are in the fonts folder.

Colors are defined at the beginning of the file so they can be easily changed

I recommend you consult this link if you have doubts [link](http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html) 

At the moment it is all, install conky copy the file in `~/.config/conky/` and modify it!
